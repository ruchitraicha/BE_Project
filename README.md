Description: Suraksha Kavach app is the way of detecting vulnerability of covid attack of person.As 
people were not aware at an early stage so many people were suffering at a large number leading to 
serious consequences. So The idea of ML based app is to make people aware regarding their 
vulnerablities of covid attack which will help people to take precautions at an early stage to avoid 
further serious consequences and protect themselves and their family. Overall this app will be easily 
available on any platform which will help people to easily access and take the benefit of it. We have 
arrived at a conclusion that ML based Suraksha Kavach App is a much viable solution for the people to 
take precautionary measures at an early stage.
